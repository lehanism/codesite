            <h1>Hello.</h1>
            <p>I'm Luke and I make websites. This particular one is the result of an experiment in trying to come up with something quite simple but a bit different after many many failed attempts at designing (ahem) and building my own personal site. For this one, I've skipped all the messing about and just used HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It was a glorious experience. I hope you enjoy it. Stay a while and click about.</p>
